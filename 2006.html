<p>2009 was one of my busiest years for seeing Dave Matthews Band, with a total of 9 different shows and several new venues being attended for the first time. The Fenway Park shows were choose for a couple of reasons: 1) It would be a cool place to see a show and, 2) My sister and brother-in-law lived in Boston at the time. This year also saw my first attendance to the band's typical two-night stand in West Palm Beach as my father and stepmother had moved to southern Florida earlier in the year. 
<br>
<br>
The latter part of the year saw me attending the final two summer shows of the year in Charlottesville, Virginia. These were special as Charlottesville is the band's hometown and were the first shows to be played there in several years. Also of note was the Dave Matthews solo performance put on Warren Haynes' Christmas Jam. An epic all-night and into-the-early-morning concert made of tons of different acts and performers. To this date, it's only the solo performance of Dave Matthews I've ever attended, as they are very rare.</p>
