<p>The tour for 2005 saw the band promoting their new album, Stand Up. As a result, setlists at these concerts were naturally heavy with Stand Up material. Of special note for this year was the fact that I able to see the band play their staple of three-night shows at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington. The amphitheatre is situated near a cliff overlooking the Columbia River. It is a truly amazing venue! If you're interested in learning more about the venue you can visit their Facebook page by clicking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GorgeAmphitheatre/">here</a>.

Another note of interest is that this was the first time I saw Dave Matthews Band perform on one of their Fall/Winter tours in Champaign, IL. I chose that stop in the tour since it was near to where father and stepmother lived in St. Louis.</p>
