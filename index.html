<p>Welcome to Thomas Makover's Dave Matthews Band webpage. Here you can find information on all the concerts that I've been to that are Dave Matthews Band-related. You will find that the shows I have attended have been broken down into years, allowing you to see each individual show and to even click on that show for more information. The type of information you will find by clicking on an individual date includes the setlist, setlist notes, interesting factoids for the show, and - when available - pictures of the ticket for each show and a picture of the concert poster.</p>

<p>Although my interest in Dave Matthews Band is not what it used to be, they are still an interesting and talented group to me. Throughout the years since 2001, I've seen a total of 57 shows, seen a 169 different songs played, 1,070 total song performances, been to 19 different venues, and have seen Dave Matthews Band concerts in 11 different states and 18 different cities (ranging from the east coast and the west coast of the U.S.). At these shows I've also seen the first-time debuts of ten songs and 25 different artists guest with Dave Matthews Band.</p>
