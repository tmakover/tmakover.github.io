<p>While 2003 saw me go to multiple concerts for the first time, only one of the concerts was a traditional Dave Matthews Band concert. The March 28 show in Winston-Salem was only Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. These are more intimate, smaller shows that feature just Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds on guitars. These type of shows are much rarer and are heavily coveted among DMB fans. The final show in December of 2003 was also not a traditional show, as it was was in support of Dave Matthews solo album, Some Devil, and was called a "Dave and Friends" show. Along with Dave Matthews on guitar and vocals, it featured Brady Blade on drums, Ray Paczkowski on keys, Tim Reynolds on guitar, Tony Hall on bass, and Trey Anastasio on guitar and vocals.
<br>
<br>
Sandwiched in between these two shows was the one traditional DMB show that I attended that year in Tennessee. The reason for choosing Tennessee that year was that I was soon going to be attended the University of Tennessee for college - before I ultimately decided to transfer to Elon University - and wanted to spend some time in the state.</p>
