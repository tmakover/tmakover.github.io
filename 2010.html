<p>2010 saw me attend concerts at Alpine Valley for the first time and is notable since I didn't have any family - at the time - living in the area. Alpine Valley was chosen because the concerts are some of the most anticipated concerts of the year, as they always put on great shows there. It's also an interesting venue to visit as it is one of the larger amphitheatres you'll see, holding around 40,000 people. The rest of the year saw me attending concerts in the areas that I typically visited, with the shows in Charlottesville added on once again for the band's hometown experience.
<br>
<br>
This was also the year that saw me sort of reach my limit with following the band around every year. I was more or less exhausted from the experience of it and found myself becoming more interested in other bands. This was probably the last year you could say that Dave Matthews Band was my favorite band. They've seen been replaced with other groups, such as Spoon, Queens of the Stone Age, and Franz Ferdinand.</p>
