<p>The year 2004 was when I really started going to see more than just a few shows per year. It was also the beginning of attending multiple concerts in a short time span. The other trend that started was attending concerts in states and towns where I had personal connections. I attended the show in Maryland Heights because my father and stepmother lived in St. Louis at the time. I attended the concerts in North Carolina since that's the state I live in. I went to the show in Atlanta since that's where I am originally from and have family there. I also attended the concert in Tennessee because I went to school there for a time and also have family in the state.
<br>
<br>
The 2004 Summer Tour was probably one of my favorite tours that I've attended. Part of this is due to the novelty of going to so many shows for the first time, but also because of the new material that the band played during this tour. On top of the new material being played, the band made good use of the songs they had already released, with interesting setlists and inspired playing at each concert.</p>
